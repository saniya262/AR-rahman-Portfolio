        <p class="main-para">A.R. Rahman is a world-renowned musician, composer, and producer from India. Born on January 6, 1967, in Chennai (formerly known as Madras), he started his music career at the age of 11 as a keyboard player in the orchestra of famous Indian composer Ilaiyaraaja.
    
          He shot to international fame in the 1990s with his work in the Tamil film "Roja", for which he won his first National Film Award. He has since won numerous awards and accolades, including two Academy Awards, two Grammy Awards, a BAFTA Award, and a Golden Globe.
          
          Apart from his work in films, Rahman has also composed music for numerous albums and collaborated with several artists from around the world. He has been recognized for his humanitarian efforts as well and was appointed as a UN Goodwill Ambassador in 2017.
          
          Rahman is known for his unique fusion of Indian classical music with electronic music and world music elements, creating a distinctive and innovative sound. His music has been described as a bridge between East and West, and has inspired a generation of musicians and composers.
